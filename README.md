# KbApp

A lightweight Kanban-style data management application to
* load data
* move it around
* export data

Currently it loads up with some very basic structures to give you some idea of what it does.

Everything currently runs *client side* so no back end is needed. A configuration will be added at some point to allow connection and persistence.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2. It is currently in development mode.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
